# An Introduction to R 

## Useful Commands

* Quit 

```{r}
q() # to quit
```
**Don't run this module**

* File path 
File path is relative to working directory 
```{r}
getwd() # get the current working directory
setwd() # set the working directory
```

* list objects in workspace
```{r}
ls()
```

## Getting Help

* Details about a specific command whose name you know(input arguments, options): 
```{r}
?t.test
help(t.test)
```

* Finding commands
Finding commands **containing a regular expression**: 
```{r}
apropos("var")
```

* HTML search 
the internet engine lets you search for topics related to regular expressions: 
```{r}
help.search("covariance")
```

* See an example of usage: 
```{r}
demo(graphics)
example(mean)
```

* Checking the function of the code
Just type the function's name with no parentheses or arguments
```{r}
plot #example
```

## R as A Calculator

```{r}
2 + 2 # addition
2 * 3 * 4 * 5 # multiplication
log2(32) # logrithm
print(sqrt(2)) # square root
pi # pi
1000 * (1 + 0.075) ^ 5 - 1000
sin(c(30, 60, 90) * pi / 180) # 
```

## Important Concept 

* Command: function 
```{r}
plot(sample-data); q()
```

* Objects:
```{r}
# vector, matrix, factor, list, and data frame
```

* Modes:
```{r}
# logical, numeric, and character
```

## Modes

* Variables:
```{r}
# Numeric
a <- 49 
sqrt(a) 

# Character string
b <- "The dog ate my homework" 
sub("dog", "cat", b) 

# Logical
d <- (1 + 1 == 3)
print(d) 
```

## Objects 

```{r}
ls()
# list all data objects currently available
rm()
# removes the data object 
typeof(a)
# determine the type of an object
class()
# determine the type of an object
```

## Vectors
```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
a * 2
t_1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
t_1
```

In `R`, a single number is the special case of a vector with 1 element. Other vector types: character strings, logical: 
```{r}
logical_vec <- c(T,F,F,F,T,T,F)
charc_vec <- c("Canberra","Sydney","Newcastle","Dar win")

## Vectors ( Expression) ##
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
1:5
seq(1, 5, by = 1) 
# sequence, start from 1, end at 5 step is 1
seq(1, 5, length = 5) 
```

## Joining Vectors

```{r}
x <- c(2, 3, 5, 2, 7, 1)
y <- c(10, 15, 12)
z <- c(x, y)
z
length(z)
```

## Subsets of Vectors 

```{r}
x <- seq(-1, 1, by = .1)
x
x[5:10]
x[c(5,7:10)]
x[-5:10]
x > 0 
x[x > 0]
```

## Exmaple

1. Create a sequence of numbers from $3$ to $30$ in steps of $3$

**Solution**: 
```{r}
a <- seq(3, 30, by = 3)
a
```
2. Create a sequence of number from $1$ to $30$ that does not include the numbers that where mentioned above(those that are divisible by $3$)

**Solution**:

```{r}
b <- seq(1, 30, by = 1)
b[-intersect(a,b)]
```

## Vector Arithmetic 

The elementary arithmetic operators are the userl `+, -, *, /` and `^` 
```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
a * 2
a - 2
a + 2
a ^ 2 
```
