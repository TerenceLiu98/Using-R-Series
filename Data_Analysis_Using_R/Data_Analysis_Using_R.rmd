### Introduction to `R`

#### What is `R`
`R` is a programming language with is **widely** using in statistics and data science.
- software;
- documentation (R-Markdown and Jupyter-notebook);
- RNews.

#### How to install `R`
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org">**Click here**</a> and you can find the answer. \\ **Remember!**, follow the direction and you may get the `R` installed properly.


<<<<<<< HEAD
In matrix, we sometimes will do some operations like production and there are
two types of production: scalar multiplication and vector multiplication and in
R, we have two functions to differentiate them: `*` and `%*%`:
```{r}
matrix_1 <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6),ncol = 3)
print(matrix_1 * 2) # scalar multiplication
#      [,1] [,2] [,3]
# [1,]    2    6   10
# [2,]    4    8   12
matrix_2 <- matrix(c(1,2,1,2,1,2), ncol = 2) # vector multiplication
print(matrix_1 %*% matrix_2)
#      [,1] [,2]
# [1,]    9   18
# [2,]   12   24
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Some Important Command of Matrix
```{r}
m <- -matrix(c(1,2,3,4),nrow <- 2 )
#      [,1] [,2]
# [1,]   -1   -3
# [2,]   -2   -4

# if we want to get the determinant of the matrix we can just use `det`
det(m)
# [1] -2

# if we want to get the transpose of the matrix, use `t()`
t(m)
#       [,1] [,2]
# [1,]   -1   -2
# [2,]   -3   -4

# if we want to get the diagonal matrix, just use `diag()`
diag(c(1,10))
#      [,1] [,2]
# [1,]    1    0
# [2,]    0   10

# to get the matrix's diagonal elements also use `diag()`
diag(m)
# [1] -1 -4

# the trace of the matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements, just use `sum` and `diag`
sum(diag(m))

# to get the inverse of a matrix use `solve`
solve(m)
#      [,1] [,2]
# [1,]    2 -1.5
# [2,]   -1  0.5

# also, `solve` can use to solve the polynomial equation
# assume that AX = b,
b <- matrix(c(1,2))
solve(m,b)
#       [,1]
# [1,]   -1
# [2,]    0
# we can get the solution of X = (-1,0)^TRUE

# if we need to get the eigen values :
eigen(m)$values
# [1] -5.3722813  0.3722813

# if we need to get the eigen vectors :
eigen(m)$Vectors
#           [,1]       [,2]
# [1,] 0.5657675  0.9093767
# [2,] 0.8245648 -0.4159736

### A very simple Example
>>>>>>> 1fc4a5546769521ae50525102254ac4b310e4e22

Assume that we are investigating growth problem, we have collected 10 baby's ages and their weight data and we are interested in the relationship between the ages and the weight distribution. 

| age | weight | 
| --- | ------ |
| 01 | 4.4 |
| 03 | 5.3 | 
| 05 | 7.2 |
| 02 | 5.2 |
| 11 | 8.5 |
| 09 | 7.3 |
| 03 | 6.0 |
| 09 | 10.4 |
| 12 | 10.2 |
| 03 | 6.1 |

We can use function `c()`, which can help us to input the ages and the weight, then we can use other function to get the mean and the standard variation of the weight, and the correlationship bwteen ages and the weight. Finally, we can use plot to show the relationship in graphic.

```{r}
age <- c(1, 3, 5, 2, 11, 9, 3, 9, 12, 3)
weight <- c(4.4, 5.3, 7.2, 5.2, 8.5, 7.3, 6.3, 10.4, 10.2, 6.1)

mean_weight <- mean(weight)
sd_weight <- sd(weight)
cor(age, weight)

plot(age, weight, main = "Age and Weight")
abline(lm(weight~age))

```

According to the code, we can get that the averge weight is $7.06$kg, the standard daviation is $2.08$kg, and the correlation is very strong $cor = 0.9$


### Workplace

**Workplace** is the working environment of the current `R`. It stores the variable that user defined ( vector, matrix, function, dataset and etc.). 


The local working directory is the default directory of R, we can use `getwd()` to check the current working directory and `setwd()` can set the work directory.

### Input and Output

#### Input

Function `source("filename")` will run a script in the current shell. 

#### Output

Function`sink("filename")` will let the output rediect to the file with filename. If the the file is exsited, the content will be covered, if you set the parameter as `append = TRUE`， it will add the text to the file instead of cover it. 

Although `sink()` can redirect the text outoput, but it will have no effect to the graphic output, if we want to output the plots, we have to use the command below and at last, use `dve.off()` to let the output back to the terminal.

**Example** 

Let us use an example to show the whole procedure: assume that we have three script files: `scrpt1.R`, `script2.R` adn `scritp3.R`: 

```{r}
source("script1.R")
```

We will run the `R` code written in `script1.R` in local window.

If we run these command:
```{r}
sink("myoutput", append = TRUE, split = TRUE)
pdf("mygraphs.pdf")
scource("scripy2.R")

sink()
dev.off()
source("scripu3.R")
```
