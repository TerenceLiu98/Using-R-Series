## Introduction
> " R is actually a programming environment and language made specifically for graphical applications and statistical computations. It is licensed under the GNU license, just like the S language, which is developed by Bell Laboratories. It is very similar to the S language, though implemented in a different manner. Because of this, some programs written in the S language can also be run in Râ€™s environment, without much alteration.""

> " The R language is very useful in the field of statistical computation and data science. It offers various techniques like clustering, time-series analysis and classification technique, nonlinear/linear modelling and classical statistical tests. Also, this language is very adaptable and extensible. Along with these, it supports many graphical techniques too. " (quoted from **Eduonix**)

There is no doubt that in statistics, `R` is a very useful tools, in fact, in UIC most of the lecturers are using R; In year three, after learning the basic mathmematical knowledge and basic programming, we can now using `R` to do some realisitic analysis.

In year three, we have ME courses ( Major Elective Courses), which containing [Bayesian Statistics], [Data analysis Using R] and [Introduction of mathmematical Finance]. As the matter of fact, these courses are all require the knowledge of `R`.
Base on this current situation, I highly recommend learning something in R and this is the companion repo for <a href="https://github.com/TerenceLiu98/Using-Python-Series">`Using-Python`</a>.
