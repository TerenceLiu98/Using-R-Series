\section{Conlcusion}
Actually, we do not have a conclusion, we just have some discovery. After we try lots of estimate methods, such as taking natural logarithm, using interaction, stepwise method, ridge and lasso regression, we still cannot estimate the data in a right way. So we think if we want to use linear regression methods to estimate our data, which is kind of time series data. Maybe we should divide the data into several single segments, then do the linear regression estimation to each single segments.
